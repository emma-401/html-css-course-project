# "HTML Project"

This project was built by Dave Gray on freeCodeCamp titled HTML Full Course for Begineers (https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode) using YouTube.


I rebuilt the project myself to practice the syntax of html which inludes links, class, id, table, paragraphy, header tags, lists (ordered and unordered), data, address, section, main, figure, article, navagition, aside,fieldset (for form creation), radio and others and its structure such as meta, head, body, and footer.

This is done to apply my knowledge gained from the [HTML for Beginners video on youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6OlAwitnFUubtE93DO-l0vu) tutorial series to build a website for The Little Taco Shop. 

**Directions:**

- There are images of the 3 web pages you need to build in the examples folder. Use them as references for what you build.

- You should name your files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

- There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. You need to link that file to your HTML files. 

- All images are provided in the img folder.

- If you need to find taco emojis, try [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/taco/). 

- A favicon is included and needs to be added in the head section of each page.
